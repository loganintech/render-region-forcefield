# RegionForcefield Configuration

# How often to update forcefields (in ticks, 20 ticks = 1 second)
update-interval-ticks: 20

# Maximum distance (in blocks) at which forcefields will be rendered
# Reducing this can improve performance on servers with many regions

# Distance between particles (in blocks)
# Smaller values = more particles = more detailed forcefields but more performance intensive
particle-spacing: 0.5

# Whether to render the walls (faces) of regions, or just the edges
# Setting to false will only render the outlines/edges
render-walls: true

# Particle color (RGB values from 0-255)
particle-color:
  red: 0
  green: 255
  blue: 255

# Particle size (recommended range: 0.5 to 2.0)
